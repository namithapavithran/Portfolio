## Namitha Pavithran
Hey there, I am Namitha, an iOS developer with 3 years of experience - currently working in Infosys Limited. Currently I live in Kerala,India.

I am a self learner and that makes me happy always. I could actively participate in whole app life cycle, from conceptualising the ideas to finally seeing the app grow. Check out some of my work below and please feel free to contact me!

### WiproGo - published in App Store

WiproGO is a first of its kind enterprise app, aimed at simplifying the process of getting a customer product tested at Wipro Tarang Lab. Using this app, user can quickly browse through Lab services and easily book the Lab for testing.

#### My contribution
I was one among  3 iOS developers worked for this app. I have worked in all the pages of this app for different features, added constraints to all the pages apart from participating in design discussions.

### Foodist

Foodist is a recipe app for everyone who likes cooking. It shows recipes based on the preferences made by the user. Important feature of Foodist is that it will read out the recipes and user could speak to the app to control recipe playing(speech recognition).

#### My contribution
I was respnsible for main page and preference page in this app. I lead the developmental flow and was giving support to my friend who made recipe detail page.

### MovieBuff

MovieBuff shows all the popular movies and currently playing movies. It has a detail page which shows movie details and cast details. The app will also search for the movie names and it automatically adds new movies to the list when scrolls down.
